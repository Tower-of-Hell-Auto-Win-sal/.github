## Overview

The Tower of Hell Auto Win Script is the ultimate speed-runner’s cheat code. Once activated, it lets your character automatically finish any tower — no jumping, no falling, just pure domination. 🏁  
From bypassing entire stages with teleport tools to unlocking GodMode, this script ensures you never touch the void again. Exclusively built for **Windows PC**, it turns even casual players into leaderboard legends.

## Feature Breakdown 🛠️

Here’s what turns this script from cool to completely cracked:

  Automatically wins every round for you — zero manual input, just pure wins.

- **🎯 Get All Items:**  
  Grants access to in-game gear without grinding or purchasing.

- **💥 GodMode:**  
  Invincibility on demand. Fall damage and death zones? Not your concern.

  Instantly zip past the entire tower and land at the finish line with style.

  Need to replay from the start? Snap right back instantly.

## 🔍 Comparison with Other Mods  

| Trait             | **Our Script**            | Rival                 |
|-------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|
| AutoWin           | Full auto win per round   | Partial or manual     |
| GodMode           | Built-in & stable         | Rare or unstable      |
| Teleport Tools    | Start & end teleport      | End-only or limited   |
| Anti-Void Support | Yes, includes anti-fail   | Often missing         |
| Item Access       | Full gear unlock          | Limited or manual     |

## Why Our Script Obliterates the Competition 💥

This isn’t just another Tower of Hell hack — it’s the meta-breaker. With **AutoWin**, you never have to climb another stage manually again. Combine that with **GodMode**, **Anti-Void**, and **Get All Items**, and you’ve basically got admin power without the badge. 🛡️  
Unlike other scripts that need tweaking or crash mid-tower, this one is battle-tested for stable use — especially on **Windows PC**.

Plus, teleportation from start to finish? That’s not a feature. That’s a flex. 😎

## System Requirements

- OS: **Windows PC only**
- Roblox installed and updated
- Executor that supports script injection (e.g., Synapse X, KRNL)

> *Note: No mobile or console compatibility.*

## Instant-Install Guide

1. Run `TowerHellAutoWin.exe`  
2. Game auto-launches  
3. Injection fires instantly — **GG!** 🎮

You’ll be winning towers before the countdown hits zero.

## Community Feedback / Safety Tips 🛡️

Players are loving how clean and automated this script feels. One user noted,  
> “After activation, I win every round in this game by myself.”

**Tip:** Use a private server to test scripts first, and always back up your executor settings. While the script disables anti-cheat, it’s smart to be cautious with aggressive trolling in public lobbies.
